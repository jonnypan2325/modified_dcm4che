For DICOM files : Send multiple dicom files or directories containing DICOM files to STOW-RS receiver at a time. \n\
For metadata+bulkdata : Send multiple bulkdata files or directories containing bulkdata files to STOW-RS receiver at a time. \
DICOM attributes can be specified via command line (using -s option) or a XML file (using -f option) \
If both the options are specified, system will generate metadata first from sample metadata file then from \
file specified by user and lastly add the attributes specified individually on command line. The Type 1 and Type 2 attributes, \
if missing, will be generated by the system. Storing bulkdata files of various Content types in one request is not possible \
i.e for eg. one can send multiple pdfs in one request, but can not send combination of files like pdfs and images in one request. \
Supported content types for bulkdata are application/pdf (for PDF files), text/xml (for CDA files), image/jpeg or image/png, \
image/jp2 or image/j2c or image/gif or image/jphc or image/jph (for images), video/mpeg or video/mp4 or video/quicktime (for videos), \
application/sla or model/stl or model/x.stl-binary (for STL files), model/mtl (for MTL files), model/obj (for OBJ files), \
application/vnd.genozip (for Genozip compressed genomic files), application/prs.vcfbzip2 (for Bzip2 compressed genomic data VCF files) \
and application/x-bzip2 (for Bzip2 compressed genomic data Document files). \n\
For metadata : Send single non bulkdata type of file by specifying a metadata file for objects like Structured Reports, \
Presentation States etc. \n\
File names shall not contain spaces. \n\-\n\
Options:
example=-\n\
Example: stowrs -s PatientName=John^Doe --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies img.jpeg \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the attribute given and img.jpeg bulkData.\n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyInstanceUID} object1.dcm object2.dcm \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the given dicom files to the specified study.\n\-\n\

=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver for specified STL file to the specified study. Additionally content type of the \n\
file returned by system will be ignored and instead specified content type shall be considered in multipart request. \n\-\n\
Example: stowrs -t json -s StudyInstanceUID=1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10 --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf \n\

/path-file2.dcm /path-file3.dcm \n\
=> Split 3 DICOM files to be sent in two http requests in one TCP connection to be sent to stowRS Receiver \n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --limit 4 --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies /dir-path-3-files \n\
/dir-path-7-files /nested-dir-path-9FilesDir1-3FilesDir2 \n\
=> Split DICOM files to be sent in 7 http requests in one TCP connection to be sent to stowRS Receiver : First http request \n\
containing 3 files from /dir-path-3-files. Next two http requests containing 4 and 3 files from /dir-path-7-files respectively. \n\
Next 3 http requests containing 4, 4 and 1 files from /nested-dir-path-9FilesDir1 respectively and the last http request \n\
containing 3 files from /nested-dir-path-3FilesDir2 \n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --limit 4 --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies /dir-path-1-file \n\
/path-file1.dcm /path-file2.dcm /path-file3.dcm /dir-path-4-files \n\
=> Split DICOM files to be sent in 3 http requests in one TCP connection to be sent to stowRS Receiver : First http request \n\
containing 1 file from /dir-path-1-file. Next http request containing 3 files for specified three file paths. Last http \n\
request containing 4 files from /dir-path-4-files \n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --contentType application/vnd.genozip --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies path-to-genozip-file.genozip \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver for specified Genozip compressed genomic file. Additionally content type of the \n\
file returned by system will be ignored and instead specified content type shall be considered in multipart request. \n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --contentType application/prs.vcfbzip2 --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies path-to-vcf-bzip2-file.vcfbz2 \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver for specified Bzip2 compressed genomic data VCF file. Additionally content type of the \n\
file returned by system will be ignored and instead specified content type shall be considered in multipart request. \n\ 
accept=Specify the value for Accept header : xml or json. \
The value of Accept header will then be sent in request header as application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
For DICOM objects, if this option is not set then application/dicom+xml will be used always by default. \
If this flag is absent, for bulkdata type of objects the value specified in -t option will be used to determine application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
If -t option is absent as well then application/dicom+xml will be used by default. 
bearer=Specify the bearer token to be used in Authorization header for server authentication. 
contentType=Specify MIME type of bulkdata file(s). If specified, content type of individual bulkdata file(s) \
(and/or in directory(-ies)) shall not be probed.
file=Specify the file containing the metadata (in XML format).
set=Specify attributes added to sent DICOM or Bulkdata objects. Attribute can be specified by keyword or tag value (in hex), \
e.g. PatientName or 00100010. Attributes in nested Datasets can be specified by including the keyword/tag value of the \
sequence attribute, e.g. 00400275.00400009 for Scheduled Procedure Step ID in the Request Attributes Sequence.
no-app=Application segments APPn are to be excluded from JPEG stream. If absent JPEG stream verbatim encapsulated by default.
pixel-header=If this option is specified, then the metadata information shall be extracted from header of pixel data \
for jpeg images, mpeg, mp4 and quicktime videos in addition to the metadata generation as explained above in description.
tsuid=Specify if the Transfer Syntax UID shall be sent in multipart request for content types image/jpeg, \
video/mpeg, video/mp4 or video/quicktime files.
type=Specify the value for Content-type header : xml or json. \
The value of Content-type will then be sent in request header as application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
If this flag is absent, for bulkdata type of objects application/dicom+xml will be used by default. \
Note that for DICOM objects, tool will always send Content-type as application/dicom.
url=Specify the request URL.
user=Specify the user name and password to use for server authentication.
httpHeader=Specify additional HTTP headers to be sent in the invoked request.
video=Send gif file as Video Photographic Image Storage by generating sample metadata from etc/stowrs/vlPhotographicImageMetadata.xml file.

individual files or specified folder paths contain files more than specified limit. Limit is not applicable to a \
combination of file paths and folder paths or if several folder paths contains files less than specified limit.
