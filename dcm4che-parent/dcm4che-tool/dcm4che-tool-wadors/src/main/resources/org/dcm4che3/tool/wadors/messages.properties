description=\n\
Wado RS client simulator. It supports retrieving Study, Series, Instance, Metadata and Bulkdata. One may choose to specify \
multiple urls as arguments. Each of the objects of the Study/series shall be saved to the current working directory \
or the directory selected by user as <uid>-001.dicom, <uid>-002.dicom and so on. The uid is determined \
based on the url(s) specified. For eg. if study is retrieved the Study IUID will be used, if the url is for series \
retrieval then Series IUID shall be used. The extension of individual parts is determined by content type of each part. \
Supported accept types for retrieving bulkdata into multiparts are application/pdf (for PDF files), text/xml (for CDA files), \
image/jpeg, video/mpeg, video/mp4, video/quicktime, image/jp2, image/png, image/gif, application/sla or model/stl or \
model/x.stl-binary (for STL files), model/mtl (for MTL files), model/obj (for OBJ files) and application/vnd.genozip \
(for Genozip compressed genomic files). \n\-\n\

Examples:\n\
=> wadors http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyIUID1} \n\
Send WADO RS request to Wado RS Receiver to retrieve studies with Study Instance UID StudyIUID1 \n\n\
=> wadors http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyIUID1} \
http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyIUID2}/series/{SeriesIUID21} \n\
Send WADO RS request to Wado RS Receiver to retrieve studies with Study Instance UID StudyIUID1 and to retrieve \
series of study with Study Instance UID StudyIUID2 and series instance UID as SeriesIUID21. \n\n\
=> wadors -a "multipart/related;type=image/jpeg" \
http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyIUID}/series/{SeriesIUID}/instances/{SOPIUID} \n\

=> wadors -a "multipart/related;type=application/vnd.genozip" \
http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyIUID} \n\
Send WADO RS request to Wado RS Receiver to retrieve all instances as a Genozip compressed genomic files. \n\ 
accept=Specify Acceptable Media Types for the response payload. Default: */* For eg. \
multipart/related;type=application/dicom;transfer-syntax=* or multipart/related;type=application/dicom or \
