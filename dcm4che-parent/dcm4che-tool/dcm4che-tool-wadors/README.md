    usage: wadors [options] [URLs...]

    Wado RS client simulator. It supports retrieving Study, Series, Instance,
    Metadata and Bulkdata. One may choose to specify multiple urls as
    arguments. Each of the objects of the Study/series shall be saved to the
    current working directory or the directory selected by user as
    <uid>-001.dicom, <uid>-002.dicom and so on. The uid is determined based on
    the url(s) specified. For eg. if study is retrieved the Study IUID will be
    used, if the url is for series retrieval then Series IUID shall be used.
    The extension of individual parts is determined by content type of each
    part. Supported accept types for retrieving bulkdata into multiparts are
    application/pdf (for PDF files), text/xml (for CDA files), image/jpeg,
    video/mpeg, video/mp4, video/quicktime, image/jp2, image/png, image/gif,
    application/sla or model/stl or model/x.stl-binary (for STL files),
    model/mtl (for MTL files), model/obj (for OBJ files) and
    application/vnd.genozip (for Genozip compressed genomic files).

     -a,--accept <arg>           Specify Acceptable Media Types for the
                                 response payload. Default: */* For eg.

        --out-dir <directory>    Specify directory where the received MIME
                                 multipart messages will be unpacked into
